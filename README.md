Project Name: Simple Calculator

Description:
The Simple Calculator project is a web-based application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This calculator is built using standard web technologies: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The project demonstrates fundamental web development skills, including UI design, responsive layout, and client-side scripting.

Features:
User Interface:

A clean, modern design with a responsive layout.
A dark-themed display for showing the input and result.
Calculator buttons are styled with Bootstrap for consistency and ease of use.
Easy-to-use interface with clearly labeled buttons.
Functionality:

Basic Operations: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Clear Function: Reset the calculator to its initial state.
Equal Function: Compute the result of the current arithmetic expression.
Decimal Support: Input and calculate decimal numbers.
Technology Stack:

HTML: Structures the calculator's layout and content.
CSS: Styles the calculator for a modern look and feel, using custom styles along with Bootstrap.
Bootstrap: Provides responsive grid layout and pre-built styles for a polished user interface.
JavaScript: Implements the calculator's logic and interactivity, handling user inputs and computing results.
Project Structure:
index.html: The main HTML file that structures the layout of the calculator, including the display screen and buttons.
style.css: A custom CSS file used to enhance the appearance of the calculator, complementing Bootstrap's styling.
script.js: The JavaScript file containing the logic for handling user inputs, performing calculations, and updating the display.
Deployment:
GitHub: The project is hosted on GitHub, allowing for version control and easy collaboration.
Netlify: The live version of the calculator is deployed on Netlify, providing users with an accessible link to use the calculator directly in their browser.
How It Works:
User Interaction:

The user inputs numbers and selects operations (e.g., +, -, *, /) using the calculator buttons.
The current input is displayed on the screen as the user types.
Computation:

When the user presses the = button, the JavaScript logic evaluates the expression.
The result is calculated and displayed on the screen.
Clear Function:

Pressing the C button resets the calculator, clearing the display and any stored operations.
Use Cases:
Educational Tool: This project is ideal for beginners learning web development, providing a hands-on example of how to integrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Practical Application: The calculator can be used for everyday arithmetic tasks.
Future Enhancements:
Advanced Operations: Extend functionality to include operations like square roots, percentages, or memory functions.
Scientific Mode: Add a mode for scientific calculations, including trigonometric functions.
Improved UI: Further refine the user interface with animations or themes.
This Simple Calculator project offers a robust foundation for understanding web development basics and can be expanded or customized for more complex use cases.
